WP Internet Connection Check (known as'Internet Connection Check' on WordPress) is a WordPress plugin that checks whether a user is online or not and 
displays prompts based on their internet connection status.

If a user is offline, a prompt that reads "Connect your internet" displays on the screen of their device; If their connection is restored, 
they get a prompt that reads "You're back online!"

The prompt is shown using AJAX to enhance user-experience.

'A former version of this plugin reloads the page when the user's internet is restored.'
